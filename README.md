# 42fillit
Tetromino partner project at 42. The goal is to take a file with tetrominos, then to fit them together in the smallest square. The tetrominos stored in the file (fillit only takes one file) are represented using hashtags in a 4 x 4 grid. Fillit will not rotate the tetrominos, but it will move them accordingly. All tetrominos consist of 4 hashtags.  

Use 'make' command to compile, then run the executable with a file containing tetrominos.
